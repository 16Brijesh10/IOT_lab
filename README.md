### Introduction: 
Internet is a network of live persons. Internet of Things or IoT is a network of 
things and persons. IoT brings the things alive and there is interacting among 
themselves and with persons lively. Internet of Things is the network of devices 
such as vehicles, and home appliances that contain electronics, software, 
actuators, and connectivity which allows these things to connect, interact and 
exchange data. With the help of embedded technology, these things can 
communicate and interact over the Internet, and they can be remotely monitored 
and controlled. In the Internet of things, the precise geographic location and also 
the dimensions of a thing is critical. Therefore, sensors, transducers, locating 
devices and networks play very important role in IoT. 
IoT makes virtually everything "smart," by improving aspects of our life with the 
power of data collection, AI algorithm, and networks. The thing in IoT can also 
be a person with a diabetes monitor implant, an animal with tracking devices, etc. 
There are many areas of applications of the Internet of Things like consumer, 
health, industrial, transportation, security, entertainment and many other. 
Security, Privacy, Complexity, Compliance, are key challenges of IoT  
### Components of IOT: 
##### ⮚ Sensors/Devices:  
Sensors or devices are a key component that helps you to collect live data from the surrounding environment. 
#####  ⮚ Connectivity: 
All the collected data is sent to a cloud infrastructure. The sensors should be connected to the cloud using various mediums of communications like Bluetooth, WI-FI, WAN, etc. 
##### ⮚ Data Processing: 
Once that data is collected, and it gets to the cloud, the software performs processing on the gathered data.  
##### ⮚ User Interface: 
The information needs to be available to the end-user in some way which can be achieved by triggering alarms on their phones or sending them notification through email or text message. 
### Advantages of IOT: 
##### ● Technical optimization 
##### ● Improved data collection 
##### ● Reduced waste 
##### ● Improved customer engagement
